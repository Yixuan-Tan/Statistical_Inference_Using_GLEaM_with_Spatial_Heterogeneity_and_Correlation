The COVID-19 data in European countries used in the paper are from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).



The COVID-19 data in China used in the paper are collected with the help of [LNKMED Tech Co ., Ltd](https://www.lnkmed.com/#/homePage) from the official websites of health commissions. The data  are not publicly available due to that the official websites of health commissions of some provinces in China no longer maintain the COVID-19 data before March of 2020,  but are available from the corresponding author on request.
